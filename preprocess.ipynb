In the meantime,  in the real world, looks like  good old Loretta Lynch was using an alias e-mail after  her very improper meeting with Bill Clinton last summer.  Alias? to hide something?   Yep.  An investigation is almost assured. Mueller has all the 'tools' in place that are  necessary to go after Lynch, Hillary and Susan Rice, possibly former President Obama and others?   And being there is absolutely nothing on Trump, he may as well.   This is going to be big.  I do believe their was 'obstruction of justice' last summer. Loretta Lynch used her power to squash the Clinton investigation. I do believe Comey will be brought back to testify as will people involved with Hillary's disastrous campaign.  Yee-haw!   \n",

       "3  Instead of wringing our hands and nibbling the periphery of the issue , how about we face the actual issue head on ? I would support a city ordinance against loitering , and applaud city councilors who champion a real and permanent solution The details could be determined , but would include a limit to persons sitting , standing , lying , smoking , conversing over a certain amount of time , perhaps 10 minutes Exceptions , of course , would be for shopping , dining , attending a licensed and approved event , etc It is noble to provide some services for the truly needy in our community , but that , in my estimation , is a separate issue I do not wish for my city to provide for nor encourage idle and harassing behaviors in our city core Enough is enough !  \n",
